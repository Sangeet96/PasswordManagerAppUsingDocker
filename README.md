## **Live Demo (Non-Docker)**  
**Older Version** repo: https://github.com/Sangeet96/Password_Manager_App

Link : [Password Manager App](https://password-manager-app-frontend.vercel.app/) This is the deployed version of the project **without Docker**.

## **What I Did?**
- **Dockerized the entire MERN app** into four containers:
  - **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js server.
  - **Frontend:** React.js interface.
  - **MongoDB:** Database container.
  - **Mongo Express:** Web-based MongoDB admin interface.
- **Created a custom Docker network** to allow seamless communication between the containers.
- **Used Docker Compose** to simplify multi-container orchestration with a single command.
- **Exposed Mongo Express** for database interaction.
